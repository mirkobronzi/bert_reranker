        "when did computer become widespread in homes and schools",

            " Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977 , and becoming common during the 1980s . They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that , for the first time , were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user . These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business , scientific or engineering - oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC , and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability . However , a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporary business computers . Their most common uses were playing video games , but they were also regularly used for word processing , doing homework , and programming . ",
            " Over 39 percent of all tornado - related deaths and many injuries come from residents of mobile homes . It is a widespread myth that tornadoes are `` attracted '' to mobile home parks , and cause the most fatalities there because they hit there the most . This is not true . However , mobile homes do often have poor construction and do not provide adequate protection during a tornado event . An example to confirm this occurred in April 1991 , when a very powerful tornado struck the town of Andover , Kansas . When the town was hit , eighty - four homes and fourteen businesses were destroyed by the tornado , but with no fatalities and only minor injuries . After the tornado hit Andover , it swept through a mobile home park consisting of 223 trailers . The park did have a tornado shelter , to which over 200 residents fled and survived without injuries . Others that did not take shelter in the tornado shelter stayed in their mobile homes , and thirteen of them were killed by the tornado . ",
            " In developed nations , computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools , homes , business , and industry . Automated teller machines , industrial robots , CGI in film and television , electronic music , bulletin board systems , and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s . Millions of people purchased home computers , making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such as Apple , Commodore , and Tandy . To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time , having sold 17 million units ( by some accounts ) between 1982 and 1994 . "

            " Life with Archie : The Married Life was based on the Archie Marries Veronica / Archie Marries Betty storyline , but was not a direct continuation on it . The series lasted from 2010 to 2014 , ending with 37 issues . Issues 1 - 35 contained two stories each , the first story was Archie Marries Veronica and the second one was Archie Marries Betty . The last two issues , on the other hand , were structured differently . Instead of having two stories both issues had one , but were twice as long as the others . Also , neither issue made it clear whether Archie was married to Betty or Veronica . Together both issues make up The Death of Archie storyline . ",

In the end , Veronica calls Betty and asks her to be her maid of honor . Instead of answering , Betty simply leaves the phone on her bed . ",

Archie and Veronica become husband and wife as Betty looks on tearfully , but happily .

In the song , Andy Samberg is a businessman , evidently in middle management , having a performance review .

            " Steam is water in the gas phase , which is formed when water boils . Steam is invisible ; however , `` steam '' often refers to wet steam , the visible mist or aerosol of water droplets formed as this water vapour condenses . At lower pressures , such as in the upper atmosphere or at the top of high mountains , water boils at a lower temperature than the nominal 100 \u00b0 C ( 212 \u00b0 F ) at standard pressure . If heated further it becomes superheated steam . ",
            " The enthalpy of vaporization is the energy required to turn water into the gaseous form when it increases in volume by 1,700 times at standard temperature and pressure ; this change in volume can be converted into mechanical work by steam engines such as reciprocating piston type engines and steam turbines , which are a sub-group of steam engines . Piston type steam engines played a central role to the Industrial Revolution and modern steam turbines are used to generate more than 80 % of the world 's electricity . If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot surface or depressurizes quickly below its vapor pressure , it can create a steam explosion . ",
            " Dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design . This type of power station is not found very often but is the most efficient . There are little emissions produced and have a simpler design to them . In these sites no water is produced but instead only the steam from that water . Dry Steam Power directly uses geothermal steam of 150 \u00b0 C or greater to turn turbines . As the turbine rotates it powers a generator which then produces electricity and adds to the power field . Then , the steam is emitted to a condenser . Here the steam turns back into a liquid which then cools the water . After the water is cooled it flows down a pipe that emerges back into the soil . "

            " Often , ticket booths are walk - up windows on the street , or are located inside restaurants and bakeries throughout a given Chinatown community , although it is not uncommon for tickets to be sold on the street directly . Some lines even simply collect cash payment after passengers have boarded the bus . However , tickets are often sold online , either by the bus companies themselves or by portals and print - outs of confirmation emails are used as tickets . Except in Boston , the lines rarely use stations of their own . Passengers are usually directed to wait along a given curbside for the arrival of the bus , although many companies offer waiting areas at or near the pickup points . Several bus stops are also near major hotels and in the parking areas of major Chinese supermarkets . In New York , several bus lines pick up passengers on a stretch of Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan 's Chinatown . Since 1998 , when the New York City Department of Transportation marked the strip a bus layover area , the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway has served as a de facto terminal for the Chinatown buses . ",
            " Chinatown buses often go from major cities to casinos . Some ' Casino Buses ' use I - 395 to make an intermediate stop at Foxwoods Resort Casino between the Massachusetts Turnpike and I - 95 . An example of this can also be found in the Southern United States where tour companies offer bus services from Houston 's Chinatown to Lake Charles area casinos . In Canada , ' Casino Buses ' are offered between Toronto and Niagara Falls , Ontario . ",
            " In Philadelphia , the Independence Transportation Center was built in part due on a 2007 survey by the Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corporation , which concluded that many tourists arrived by bus and that some Chinatown buses disruptively parked on the street . People living closer to Chinatown bus stops in Philadelphia 's Chinatown were more likely to complain about the buses . Similarly , in Washington , D.C. , interim bus loading regulations were enacted in 2008 due to complaints about disruptive bus layovers . In Boston in 2004 , the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority required Chinatown buses to make stops inside South Station and to have permits . Although Fung Wah Bus Transportation was often ticketed for curbside parking offenses in Boston , they eventually became one of two Chinatown buses headquartered in South Station ( besides Lucky Star Bus ) because the fines for curbside parking were becoming higher than the South Station terminal fees .

The names of access levels are the same for users and servers . Only a user with Manager access can create or modify the ACL . To set an ACL , the Manager selects the access level , user type , and access level privileges for each user or group in a database . Default entries in the ACL can be set when the Manager creates the database . The manager can also assign roles if the database designer determines this level of access refinement is needed by the application ; for instance , when users within the same group must be provided different levels of access .

He suggests that the primary delusionary experience , like other phenomena of psychosis such as hallucinations and secondary or specific delusions , represents an intrusion into waking consciousness of processes associated with stage 1 sleep . It is suggested that the reason for these intrusions is that the psychotic subject is in a state of hyper - arousal , a state that can lead to what Ian Oswald called `` micro-sleeps '' in waking life .
