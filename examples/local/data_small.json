            " Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977 , and becoming common during the 1980s . They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that , for the first time , were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user . These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business , scientific or engineering - oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC , and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability . However , a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporary business computers . Their most common uses were playing video games , but they were also regularly used for word processing , doing homework , and programming . ",
            " Over 39 percent of all tornado - related deaths and many injuries come from residents of mobile homes . It is a widespread myth that tornadoes are `` attracted '' to mobile home parks , and cause the most fatalities there because they hit there the most . This is not true . However , mobile homes do often have poor construction and do not provide adequate protection during a tornado event . An example to confirm this occurred in April 1991 , when a very powerful tornado struck the town of Andover , Kansas . When the town was hit , eighty - four homes and fourteen businesses were destroyed by the tornado , but with no fatalities and only minor injuries . After the tornado hit Andover , it swept through a mobile home park consisting of 223 trailers . The park did have a tornado shelter , to which over 200 residents fled and survived without injuries . Others that did not take shelter in the tornado shelter stayed in their mobile homes , and thirteen of them were killed by the tornado . ",
            " In developed nations , computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools , homes , business , and industry . Automated teller machines , industrial robots , CGI in film and television , electronic music , bulletin board systems , and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s . Millions of people purchased home computers , making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such as Apple , Commodore , and Tandy . To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time , having sold 17 million units ( by some accounts ) between 1982 and 1994 . "
