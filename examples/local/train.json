        "what is an advantage of daily vertical migration by marine zooplankton quizlet",
        [
            " Diel vertical migration ( DVM ) , also known as diurnal vertical migration , is a pattern of movement used by some organisms , such as copepods , living in the ocean and in lakes . The migration occurs when organisms move up to the epipelagic zone at night and return to the mesopelagic zone of the oceans or to the hypolimnion zone of lakes during the day . The word diel comes from the Latin dies day , and means a 24 - hour period . It is the greatest migration in the world in terms of biomass . This form of migration is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from crustaceans ( copepods ) , molluscs ( squid ) , and ray - finned fishes ( trout ) . There are various stimuli responsible for this phenomenon , the most prominent being response to changes in light intensity , though evidence suggests that biological clock s are an underlying stimulus as well . There are a number of potential reasons to explain the phenomenon in nature , though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators . While this mass migration is typically nocturnal , with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise , novel types of vertical migration can occur in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger migration . Some novel events include the absence of DVM during midnight sun in Arctic regions and the sudden onset of migration due to a solar eclipse . ",
            " Pressure changes have been found to produce differential responses that result in vertical migration . many zooplankton will react to increased pressure with positive phototaxis , a negative geotaxis , and / or a kinetic response that results in ascending in the water column . Likewise , when there is a decrease in pressure , the zoo plankton respond by passively sinking or active downward swimming to descend in the water column . ",
            " Changes in salinity may promote organism to seek out more suitable waters if they happen to be stenohaline or unequipped to handle regulating their osmotic pressure . Areas that are impacted by tidal cycles accompanied by salinity changes , estuaries for example , may see vertical migration in some species of zooplankton . In areas such as the Arctic , melting ice causes a layer of freshwater which organisms can not cross . "

        [
            " Peer - to - peer lending , also abbreviated as P2P lending , is the practice of lending money to individuals or businesses through online services that match lenders with borrowers . Since peer - to - peer lending companies offering these services generally operate online , they can run with lower overhead and provide the service more cheaply than traditional financial institutions . As a result , lenders can earn higher returns compared to savings and investment products offered by banks , while borrowers can borrow money at lower interest rates , even after the P2P lending company has taken a fee for providing the match - making platform and credit checking the borrower . There is the risk of the borrower defaulting on the loans taken out from peer - lending websites . ",
            " In India , peer - to - peer lending is currently unregulated . The Reserve Bank of India , India 's Central Bank , has published a consultation paper on regulation of P2P lending and the final guidelines are expected soon . The RBI has regulated that all the registered NBFC - P2P must have a net owned fund of not less than 2 crores and the management and directors of the P2P platform need to fulfill the ' Fit and Proper ' criteria as laid out by RBI . This is necessary for the encouragement of the credibility of the industry . There were over 30 peer - to - peer - lending platforms in India in 2016 . Even with first - mover advantage many sites were not able to capture market share and grow their user base , arguably because of the reserved nature of Indian investors or lack of awareness of this type of debt financing . However , peer - to - peer lending platforms in India are helping a huge section of borrowers who have previously been rejected or have failed to qualify for a loan from banks . Peer to peer lending has helped consumers with no or poor credit scores get loans in categories such as consumer lending , small business lending and property lending . After regulation by the Reserve Bank of India begins , the peer to peer lending industry in India is expected to grow . ",

            " The United Nations Security Council `` veto power '' refers to the power of the permanent members of the UN Security Council ( China , France , Russia , United Kingdom , and United States ) to veto any `` substantive '' resolution . A permanent member 's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted . This veto power does not apply to `` procedural '' votes , as determined by the permanent members themselves . A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary - General , although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors . ",
            " The unconditional veto possessed by the five governments has been seen by critics as the most undemocratic character of the UN . Critics also claim that veto power is the main cause for international inaction on war crimes and crimes against humanity . However , the United States refused to join the United Nations in 1945 unless it was given a veto . The absence of the United States from the League of Nations contributed to its ineffectiveness . Supporters of the veto power regard it as a promoter of international stability , a check against military interventions , and a critical safeguard against U.S. domination . ",
            " Shortly after the establishment of the United Nations , the United States came into conflict with another member of the Security Council . Since the Soviet Union was a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , it had the power to veto any binding UN resolution .

            " Major referendums have been rare in the UK , and have only been held on major constitutional issues . Before Tony Blair 's Labour government came to power in 1997 , only four such referendums had been held . Historically referendums within the United Kingdom were opposed on the supposition that they violate the principle of parliamentary sovereignty . In May 1945 the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested holding a referendum over the question of extending the life of his wartime Coalition until victory was won over Japan , be allowed to continue in office . However , Clement Attlee refused citing ' I could not consent to the introduction into our national life of a device so alien to all our traditions as the referendum which has only too often been the instrument of Nazism and Fascism . ' implying that referendums were a totally unknown and alien device to British politics . In March 1975 Margaret Thatcher also quoted Clement Attlee that referendums are `` a device of dictators and demagogues '' as Napoleon , Mussolini and Hitler had exploited their use in the past . ",
            " There are two types of referendum that have been held by the UK Government , pre-legislative ( held before proposed legislation is passed ) and post-legislative ( held after legislation is passed ) . To date the previous three UK - wide referendums in 1975 , 2011 and 2016 were all post-legislative . Referendums are not legally binding , so legally the Government can ignore the results ; for example , even if the result of a pre-legislative referendum were a majority of `` No '' for a proposed law , Parliament could pass it anyway , because parliament is sovereign .

Despite the number of referendums that was held during this period no UK - wide referendum was held .

            " Identity theft is the deliberate use of someone else 's identity , usually as a method to gain a financial advantage or obtain credit and other benefits in the other person 's name , and perhaps to the other person 's disadvantage or loss . The person whose identity has been assumed may suffer adverse consequences , especially if they are held responsible for the perpetrator 's actions . Identity theft occurs when someone uses another 's personally identifying information , like their name , identifying number , or credit card number , without their permission , to commit fraud or other crimes . The term identity theft was coined in 1964 . Since that time , the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally identifying information , generally including a person 's name , date of birth , social security number , driver 's license number , bank account or credit card numbers , PIN numbers , electronic signatures , fingerprints , passwords , or any other information that can be used to access a person 's financial resources . ",
            " Identity theft can be partially mitigated by not identifying oneself unnecessarily ( a form of information security control known as risk avoidance ) . This implies that organizations , IT systems and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication . Requiring , storing and processing personal identifiers ( such as Social Security number , national identification number , driver 's license number , credit card number , etc . ) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times . Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would - be identity thief from obtaining these records . To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers , it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System . ",
            " Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging , primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained , and identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims , according to a report done for the FTC . Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft . Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person , such as when a major data breach occurs . A US Government Accountability Office study determined that `` most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft '' . The report also warned that `` the full extent is unknown '' . A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that `` Most often , the causes of identity theft is not known '' , but reported that someone else concluded that `` the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2 % '' . More recently , an association of consumer data companies noted that one of the largest data breaches ever , accounting for over four million records , resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft , according to the company whose systems were breached .

            " The Adams -- On\u00eds Treaty of 1819 , also known as the Transcontinental Treaty , the Florida Purchase Treaty , or the Florida Treaty , was a treaty between the United States and Spain in 1819 that ceded Florida to the U.S. and defined the boundary between the U.S. and New Spain . It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries and was considered a triumph of American diplomacy . It came in the midst of increasing tensions related to Spain 's territorial boundaries in North America against the United States and Great Britain in the aftermath of the American Revolution ; and also during the Latin American Wars of Independence . Florida had become a burden to Spain , which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons . Madrid decided to cede the territory to the United States through the Adams -- On\u00eds Treaty in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the Sabine River in Spanish Texas . The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory and claims through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean , in exchange for the U.S. paying residents ' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5,000,000 and relinquishing the US claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas , under the terms of the Louisiana Purchase . ",
            " Spain accepted and eventually resumed negotiations for the sale of Florida . Defending Jackson 's actions as necessary , and sensing that they strengthened his diplomatic standing , Adams demanded Spain either control the inhabitants of East Florida or cede it to the United States . An agreement was then reached whereby Spain ceded East Florida to the United States and renounced all claim to West . ",
            " Spain did cede Florida , and the United States took possession in 1821 . Effective government was slow in coming to Florida . General Andrew Jackson was appointed military governor of Florida in March 1821 , but he did not arrive in Pensacola until July 1821 . He resigned the post in September 1821 and returned home in October , having spent just three months in Florida . His successor , William P. Duval , was not appointed until April 1822 , and he left for an extended visit to his home in Kentucky before the end of the year . Other official positions in the territory had similar turn - over and absences . "

            " In music , polyphony is one type of musical texture , where a texture is , generally speaking , the way that melodic , rhythmic , and harmonic aspects of a musical composition are combined to shape the overall sound and quality of the work . In particular , polyphony consists of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody , as opposed to a musical texture with just one voice , monophony , or a texture with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords , which is called homophony . ",
            " Since polyphonic textures with interweaving melodic lines were no longer the main focus of music ( excluding in the development section ) , a single melodic line with accompaniment became the main texture . In the Classical era , there was greater emphasis on notating that line for dynamics and phrasing . This contrasts with the Baroque era , when melodies were typically written with no dynamics , phrasing marks or ornaments , as it was assumed that the performer would improvise these elements on the spot . In the Classical era , it became more common for composers to indicate where they wanted performers to play ornaments such as trills or turns . The simplification of texture made such instrumental detail more important , and also made the use of characteristic rhythms , such as attention - getting opening fanfares , the funeral march rhythm , or the minuet genre , more important in establishing and unifying the tone of a single movement .

Fans of Beat Generation literature , Fagen and Becker named the band after `` Steely Dan III from Yokohama '' , an oversized , steam - powered strap - on dildo mentioned in the William S.

Frey commented , `` We just wanted to allude to Steely Dan rather than mentioning them outright , so ' Dan ' got changed to ' knives , ' which is still , you know , a penile metaphor . '' . This comment refers to the name 's claimed origin in William S. Burroughs ' book Naked Lunch . Timothy B. Schmit , who sang background vocals on `` The Royal Scam '' would later join the Eagles . ",

According to Glenn Frey 's liner notes for The Very Best Of , the use of the word `` steely '' in the lyric , `` They stab it with their steely knives , but they just ca n't kill the beast , '' was a playful nod to the band Steely Dan , who had included the lyric `` Turn up the Eagles , the neighbors are listening '' in their song `` Everything You Did '' . Frey had also said that the writing of the song was inspired by the boldness of Steely Dan 's lyrics and its willingness to go `` out there '' , and thought that the song they wrote had `` achieved perfect ambiguity .

        "what type of receptors are in the ear",
        [
            " Hair cells are the sensory receptors of both the auditory system and the vestibular system in the ears of all vertebrates . Through mechanotransduction , hair cells detect movement in their environment . In mammals , the auditory hair cells are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear . They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called hair bundles that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid - filled cochlear duct . Mammalian cochlear hair cells are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types , known as outer , and inner hair cells . Damage to these hair cells results in decreased hearing sensitivity , and because the inner ear hair cells can not regenerate , this damage is permanent . However , other organisms , such as the frequently studied zebrafish , and birds have hair cells that can regenerate . The human cochlea contains on the order of 3,500 inner hair cells and 12,000 outer hair cells at birth . ",
            " Depending on their mechanism of action and subcellular distribution , nuclear receptors may be classified into at least two classes . Nuclear receptors that bind steroid hormones are all classified as type I receptors . Only type I receptors have a heat shock protein ( HSP ) associated with the inactive receptor that will be released when the receptor interacts with the ligand . Type I receptors may be found in homodimer or heterodimer forms . Type II nuclear receptors have no HSP , and in contrast to the classical type I receptor are located in the cell nucleus . ",
            " Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand - gated ion channels permeable to sodium , potassium , and calcium ions . In other words , they are ion channels embedded in cell membranes , capable of switching from a closed to open state when acetylcholine binds to them ; in the open state they allow ions to pass through . Nicotinic receptors come in two main types , known as muscle - type and neuronal - type . The muscle - type can be selectively blocked by curare , the neuronal - type by hexamethonium . The main location of muscle - type receptors is on muscle cells , as described in more detail below . Neuronal - type receptors are located in autonomic ganglia ( both sympathetic and parasympathetic ) , and in the central nervous system . "

        "what do you call rocks that form when flowing lava solidifies",
        [
            " Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption . The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called lava . The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets , including Earth , and some of their satellites . The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy . When first erupted from a volcanic vent , lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from 700 to 1,200 \u00b0 C ( 1,292 to 2,192 \u00b0 F ) . ",
            " Extrusive igneous rocks , also known as volcanic rocks , are formed at the crust 's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust . Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks . They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth 's surface . The magma , which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions , solidifies at a faster rate . Hence such rocks are smooth , crystalline and fine - grained . Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows , lava sheets and lava plateaus . Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns . The Giant 's Causeway in Antrim , Northern Ireland is an example . ",
            " A lava flow is a moving outpouring of lava created during a non-explosive effusive eruption . When it has stopped moving , lava solidifies to form igneous rock . The term lava flow is commonly shortened to lava . Although lava can be up to 100,000 times more viscous than water , lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and shear thinning properties . "

            " The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .

This discussion turned into a published article , which received so much positive publicity that on March 14 , 1950 , the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement 's ability to capture dangerous fugitives . ",
            " The concept of the list began in late 1949 , when the FBI helped publish an article about the `` toughest guys '' the Bureau was after , who remained fugitives from justice . The Washington Daily News article was titled , `` FBI 's Most Wanted Fugitives Named , '' and appeared on February 7 , 1949 . The positive publicity from the story resulted in the birth of the FBI 's `` Ten Most Wanted Fugitives '' list on March 14 , 1950 . "

The now uninhabited island is formed from the volcanic plug of an extinct volcano . ",
            " Curling stones are traditionally fashioned of Ailsa Craig granite . The first stones were made in the 1750s , the original source being Ailsa Craig in Scotland . Because of the rarity of this granite , the best stones can cost as much as US $1,500 . Between 60 and 70 percent of the stones used today are made from Ailsa Craig granite , although the island is now a wildlife reserve and is still used for quarrying under license for Ailsa granite by Kays of Mauchline for curling stones . ",
            " Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones in Mauchline , Ayrshire , since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite , granted by the Marquess of Ailsa , whose family has owned the island since 1560 . According to the 1881 Census , Andrew Kay employed 30 people in his curling stone factory in Mauchline . The last harvest of Ailsa Craig granite by Kays took place in 2013 , after a hiatus of 11 years ; 2,000 tons were harvested , sufficient to fill anticipated orders through at least 2020 . Kays have been involved in providing curling stones for the Winter Olympics since Chamonix in 1924 and has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics since the 2006 Winter Olympics .

            " Unlike the trophies awarded by the other major professional sports leagues of North America , a new Stanley Cup is not made each year . Originally , the winners kept it until a new champion was crowned . Currently , winning teams get the Stanley Cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season . It is unusual among trophies to include winning members ' names . Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted . Initially a new band added each year , though this caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' . In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom . It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug . The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions , the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team . ",

NASA commonly employs the terms `` L - minus '' and `` T - minus '' during the preparation for and anticipation of a rocket launch , and even `` E-minus '' for events that involve spacecraft that are already in space , where the `` T '' could stand for `` Test '' or `` Time '' , and the `` E '' stands for `` Encounter '' , as with a comet or some other space object . Other events for which countdowns are commonly used include the detonation of an explosive , the start of a race , the start of the New Year , or any anxiously anticipated event . An early use of a countdown once signaled the start of a Cambridge University rowing race . One of the first known associations with rockets was in the 1929 German science fiction movie Frau im Mond ( English : Woman in the Moon ) written by Thea von Harbou and directed by Fritz Lang in an attempt to increase the drama of the launch sequence of the story 's lunar - bound rocket .

            " Nimbostratus is a stratiform genus formerly classified as `` Family C '' low - level , but now considered by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) to be a middle - or multi-level stratus type. . Although it is usually a low - based cloud , it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels . This change in classification would once have made it a `` Family D '' cloud , but this style of nomenclature was discontinued by the WMO in 1956 . Nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area . Nimbo - is from the Latin word nimbus , which denotes precipitation . It has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) in the middle level of the troposphere . Although usually dark at its base , it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer . Nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 m . Though found worldwide , nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes . It is coded C 2 on the SYNOP report . ",

If observed during a storm , these clouds may be referred to as thunderheads . Cumulonimbus can form alone , in clusters , or along cold front squall lines . These clouds are capable of producing lightning and other dangerous severe weather , such as tornadoes . Cumulonimbus progress from overdeveloped cumulus congestus clouds and may further develop as part of a supercell . Cumulonimbus is abbreviated Cb . ",
            " Later , in the 20th Century , an IMC commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus , effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type . It was then renamed nimbostratus , and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky . This left cumulonimbus as the only nimbiform type as indicated by its root - name . "

The name signifies Bangalore 's status as a hub for information technology companies in India and is a comparative reference to the original Silicon Valley ( San Francisco Bay Area , California ) , the major hub for information technology companies in the United States and in the world . One of the earliest mentions of this sobriquet occurred in late 2012 by CNN . The more prevalent application of the nickname Bangalore began in the 1990s based on a concentration of firms specializing in research and development ( R&D ) , electronics and software production . ",

It is not an unreasonable comparison to make between Bangalore city and Silicon Valley ; Bangalore has the ingredients to become Silicon Valley ... It is probably the only city in India that could become one . ",

The use of the term `` Silicon Valley of India '' to refer to Bangalore grew in local media and as time progressed , in international media too . An article entitled `` Is the Next Silicon Valley Taking Root in Bangalore ? '' appeared in the New York Times in 2006 An article in the BBC speculated if Bangalore could one day be as large as the American Silicon Valley .

CNP was established in 1928 as the first printing press for bank notes in India . Both CNP , located in Nashik , Maharashtra , and BNP , located in Dewas , Madhya Pradesh , print the Indian currency notes . They are currently responsible for the printing of the new 500 rupee notes following the demonetisation of the old 500 rupee and 1000 rupee note . Currency is also printed by the two presses of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited , a wholly owned subsidiary of Reserve Bank of India . They are currently responsible for the printing of the new 2000 rupee notes , and speculations suggest that the printing of the 500 rupee notes will also shift to these presses for better speed and fewer errors . BNP also has an ink factory that produces ink for security printing . India Security Press , located in Nashik , and Security Printing Press , located in Hyderabad , produce travel documents , postage stamps , and other government - related documents . "

Much of the band 's music was , as music historian Richie Unterberger described it , possessed of `` an eerie and sometimes anguished ambiance '' , and , early on , mainly consisted of material by songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz , though the group also penned their own songs . Incorporating psychedelia and elements of embryonic electronic rock , the band 's sound was marked by innovative recording techniques with fuzz - toned guitars and oscillating sound effects . In addition , guitarist Ken Williams ' and singer James Lowe 's concept of `` free - form garage music '' provided the band with a richer sonic palette and exploratory lyrical structure than many of their contemporaries .

Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the tissues , except for pulmonary arteries , which carry blood to the lungs for oxygenation ( usually veins carry deoxygenated blood to the heart but the pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood as well ) . There are two types of unique arteries . The pulmonary artery carries blood from the heart to the lungs , where it receives oxygen . It is unique because the blood in it is not `` oxygenated '' , as it has not yet passed through the lungs . The other unique artery is the umbilical artery , which carries deoxygenated blood from a fetus to its mother . ",

As the aorta branches , and these arteries branch in turn , they become successively smaller in diameter , down to the arterioles . The arterioles supply capillaries , which in turn empty into venules . The very first branches off of the aorta are the coronary arteries , which supply blood to the heart muscle itself .

        [
            " Tribunus plebis , rendered in English as tribune of the plebs , tribune of the people , or plebeian tribune , was the first office of the Roman state that was open to the plebeians , and throughout the history of the Republic , the most important check on the power of the Roman Senate and magistrates . These tribunes had the power to convene and preside over the Concilium Plebis , or people 's assembly ; to summon the senate ; to propose legislation ; and to intervene on behalf of plebeians in legal matters ; but the most significant power of these tribunes was the power to veto the actions of the consuls and other magistrates , thus protecting the interests of the plebeians as a class . The tribunes of the plebs were sacrosanct , meaning that any assault on their person was prohibited by law . In imperial times , the powers of the tribunate were granted to the emperor as a matter of course , and the office itself lost its independence and most of its functions . During the day the tribunes used to sit on the tribune benches on the Forum Romanum . ",
            " Since the tribunes were considered to be the embodiment of the plebeians , they were sacrosanct . Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge , taken by the plebeians , to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office . All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity . One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune , to disregard his veto , or to interfere with a tribune . In times of military emergency , a dictator would be appointed for a term of six months . Constitutional government would be dissolved , and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state . When the dictator 's term ended , constitutional government would be restored . ",
            " Because the sacrosanctity of the tribunes depended on the oath of the plebeians to defend them , their powers were effectively limited to the boundaries of the city of Rome . A tribune traveling abroad could not rely on his authority to intervene on behalf of the plebeians . For this reason , the activities of the tribunes were normally confined to the city itself , and a one - mile radius beyond . "

Additionally , a right of interstate travel may plausibly be inferred from the clause . ",
            " In the 1833 case of Barron v. Baltimore , the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Bill of Rights did not apply to state governments ; such protections were instead provided by the constitutions of each state . After the Civil War , Congress and the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment , which included the Due Process Clause and the Privileges or Immunities Clause . While the Fifth Amendment had included a due process clause , the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment crucially differed from the Fifth Amendment in that it explicitly applied to the states . The Privileges or Immunities Clause also explicitly applied to the states , unlike the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV of the Constitution . In the Slaughter - House Cases ( 1873 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was not designed to protect individuals from the actions of state governments . In Twining v. New Jersey ( 1908 ) , the Supreme Court acknowledged that the Due Process Clause might incorporate some of the Bill of Rights , but continued to reject any incorporation under the Privileges or Immunities Clause .

The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success . In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as `` Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations . '' ",
            " In the first four editions of On the Origin of Species , Darwin had used the phrase `` natural selection '' . In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of The Origin published in 1869 , Darwin implies again the synonym : `` Natural Selection , or the Survival of the Fittest '' . By the word `` fittest '' Darwin meant `` better adapted for immediate , local environment '' , not the common modern meaning of `` in the best physical shape '' ( think of a puzzle piece , not an athlete ) . In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer , writing `` I have called this principle , by which each slight variation , if useful , is preserved , by the term Natural Selection , in order to mark its relation to man 's power of selection . But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate , and is sometimes equally convenient . '' ",
            " However , the expression `` survival of the fittest '' ( taken on its own and out of context ) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection . The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection , namely the requirement of heritability . It is true that the phrase `` survival of the fittest '' , in and by itself , is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction . Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by heritable characters ( see the article on natural selection ) . "
