In fact, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced. It is the council that determines whether the public meeting is suspended or replaced.Suspension - If its council chooses to suspend the public meeting, the municipality should announce this decision by a public notice of postponement that indicates that a new public notice announcing the meeting will be issued once the health emergency is over. In this case, the regulatory adoption process is suspended until further notice. In due course, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation will contact municipalities to advise them that regular regulatory adoption processes are being reinstated.Replacement - If a council wishes to continue the process of passing the act that is the subject of the public meeting, it must designate it as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by public notice. This has the effect of cancelling the meeting.   The Ministère recommends that this public notice describe the project that was to be the subject of a meeting but is instead the subject of a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is made available online.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.Given the isolation of citizens, the government is asking municipalities to postpone (suspend) non-priority projects. Consultation by call for comments must be reserved for projects deemed to be priorities. Priority is given to a project that, for example, fosters public health or safety, contributes to environmental protection, represents a major economic opportunity for the community, has significant public support, etc.  During a health emergency, a project initially suspended by a municipality could be revived at a later date if public notice was given to announce that the public meeting is being replaced by the written consultation described above.

It is best to prepare a new diluted solution every day and not to mix bleach with any other cleaning products.A 0.1% hypochlorite solution is sufficient to eliminate viruses such as coronavirus, which is less resistant than other pathogenic microorganisms.This is in line with current scientific literature on coronavirus and complies with recommendations from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ).In the current context and according to the available scientific data, the proportions usually recommended (1:200) must be increased to 1:50 (equivalent to a 0.1% solution of sodium hypochlorite) as a precautionary measure. When a solution of 0.1% sodium hypochlorite is used on food contact surfaces, those surfaces must also be rinsed off to limit the risks of chemical hazards.We are monitoring the scientific data on the subject."

Whereas in January and February, COVID‑19 was spread by returning travellers, most cases are now caused by community transmission.This means that testing priorities need to be revised. From now on, testing will focus on people who are most at risk of being hospitalized or developing complications due to the infection and on people who play a critical role in the fight against the infection in Québec.This prioritization of testing will help maintain health services, first responder services and essential services by identifying symptomatic people who might be involved in outbreaks in their workplace and among people who are at risk."

The interactive form costs nothing to use, and is simple and quick to complete. Simply enter your data, and the calculation will be carried out automatically.Before adjusting the amount of child support payable, if you’ve lost your job, for instance, it would be best to know the amounts to which you will be entitled in order to determine your income. The child support payment amount can also include costs related to children, for example daycare costs. Since parents will not have to cover these costs during the pandemic whether or not they are entitled to emergency daycare services, they may be taken into account when reviewing the support payable, but only for the period during which these fees are waived. Educational childcare services will be free for parents who are essential service workers, which entitles them to emergency daycare services. Parents’ contributions will be covered by the Ministère de la Famille. Parents who can no longer use educational childcare services during the public health emergency will no longer have to pay childcare costs.

In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted. If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality). Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws. During a health emergency, the Minister of Health and Social Services has the power to order the construction of any work or the installation of facilities for health purposes or the provision of health and social services. To do so, the minister is not required to comply with the regulations in force.Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and creation of financial reservesFor these projects, the municipality cannot undertake a registration process for qualified voters and referendum voting during a health emergency. As is normally the case, qualified voters cannot apply for these types of projects. However, in order to determine the applicable procedure, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of the members of council, whether the project is a priority.For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. The procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice  \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. \t\t For projects deemed to be non-priority, the municipality will suspend the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted. For all borrowing by-laws, regardless of the applicable procedure (priority project or project exempted from the referendum approval process), the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve them, as is normally the case.Municipal territorial organization – The Act respecting  municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of referendum approval processes in certain situations (municipal groupings, name change, change of regime, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality, etc.).  However, this process occurs only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date stipulated by the latter. During a health emergency, if such a referendum process were to be ordered, it would not be held until the health emergency is lifted. The process would therefore be suspended until further notice.",

Adherence to good food hygiene and safety practices and safe cooking generally minimizes the risk of transmission of any foodborne contamination and illness.Food establishment operators (restaurants, supermarkets, slaughterhouses, butchers, dairy plants, processing plants, etc.) play an important role in preventing foodborne illnesses. In the current context, they should follow public health recommendations and the following guidelines:Ensure that staff under their responsibility are aware of issues related to COVID19;Rest assured that the staff respect the rigorous sanitary guidelines recommended by the public health authorities;Ensure that food handlers are properly trained in food hygiene practices;Ensure effective supervision of food handlers to enhance hygiene practices in the establishment;Ensure that the appropriate facilities are available for hand washing;Ensure that food handlers are aware that they must report any symptoms of respiratory illness before or during work;Ensure that food handlers and other personnel are not ill;Ensure that staff with symptoms remain at home until medical advice is received;Enhance cleaning and sanitation procedures for items that are exposed to public handling (handles, crates, counters, menus, etc.). Special attention should be paid to fast food or self-service locations where utensils can be handled by several people;The use of self-service buffets where people have to wait in line, close to each other and close to food and utensils, is an increased risk and should be avoided;Provide for additional or alternative refrigerated or frozen storage capacities to meet the food demand, which is likely subject to change (decreased demand in the hotel, restaurant and institutional sectors, increased demand for food products at retail locations);Prepare an action plan in the event of a labour shortage. Do not neglect cleaning and sanitation activities and processing methods that require qualifications. If necessary, prioritize activities that ensure the best means of food availability and abandon other activities.The Public health expertise and reference centre (INSPQ) has produced a series of documents outlining preventative measures to take against the spread of COVID-19 in different work environments , with some of those pertaining to the food industry. ",

The owner of the animal boarding establishment is responsible for providing their basic needs, such as food, shelter (e.g. ensuring cleanliness of the site and important elements such as litter) and emergency medical care, all while respecting the hygiene measures recommended by the MSSS (e.g. social distancing). The owner of the animal boarding establishment must take the appropriate measures to ensure that staffing is sufficient to provide this care. The animals must also be able to exercise.Given the situation of the pandemic, while daily exercise or yard time is recommended, this period must be evaluated and established relative to the particular needs of the animals being lodged and the resources available.The cooperation of citizens and businesses is essential to ensure the wellbeing of the animals, all while prioritizing public health."

            "No public meetings required by a legislative or regulatory provision applicable to a municipality or metropolitan community may be held. This is the case, in particular, for meetings scheduled for purposes of development and urban planning. In fact, under order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body is suspended or replaced. It is the council that determines whether the public meeting is suspended or replaced.Suspension - If its council chooses to suspend the public meeting, the municipality should announce this decision by a public notice of postponement that indicates that a new public notice announcing the meeting will be issued once the health emergency is over. In this case, the regulatory adoption process is suspended until further notice. In due course, the ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation will contact municipalities to advise them that regular regulatory adoption processes are being reinstated.Replacement - If a council wishes to continue the process of passing the act that is the subject of the public meeting, it must designate it as a priority by a two-thirds majority vote. The consultation meeting is then replaced by a written consultation announced 15 days in advance by public notice. This has the effect of cancelling the meeting.   The Ministère recommends that this public notice describe the project that was to be the subject of a meeting but is instead the subject of a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is made available online.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.Given the isolation of citizens, the government is asking municipalities to postpone (suspend) non-priority projects. Consultation by call for comments must be reserved for projects deemed to be priorities. Priority is given to a project that, for example, fosters public health or safety, contributes to environmental protection, represents a major economic opportunity for the community, has significant public support, etc.  During a health emergency, a project initially suspended by a municipality could be revived at a later date if public notice was given to announce that the public meeting is being replaced by the written consultation described above. Finally, in addition to the usually mandatory consultation meetings, municipalities must not hold optional consultations (e.g., a public hearing by a municipality's demolition committee). The government is asking municipalities to consult citizens in other ways (survey or online consultation), or to postpone processes involving optional consultations.",

The flexibilities required to take the situation into account must therefore be discussed with the associations and unions.Despite the obligation to adopt a balanced budget, a municipality cannot base a decision to lay off employees on the illegality of running a deficit during the year. Indeed, the law expressly provides for mechanisms to enable municipalities to run deficits. The decision to proceed with layoffs is therefore a matter of municipal policy considerations rather than the application of legal provisions."

            "Pursuant to order 2020-008 of March 22, 2020, any procedure involving the movement or gathering of citizens that is part of the decision-making process of a municipal body, including a referendum process, must be suspended or replaced. Nevertheless, citizens could submit requests to the municipality to open a register. Here are some additional indications, depending on the situation.Planning and development - For draft by-laws under the Act respecting land use planning and development, the municipality may not proceed with the registration of qualified voters and the referendum process during a health emergency. However, qualified voters may submit applications for referendums. These applications may be forwarded to the municipality individually, rather than by petition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The public notice announcing that provisions are subject to referendum approval could invite qualified voters to transmit their requests in this way.  If it receives a sufficient number of requests, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of council members, whether the project is a priority. For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation identical to the one planned as an alternative to public consultation meetings. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. If it has already held such a written consultation to replace the meeting provided for in the Act, it does not have to repeat it and the regulatory adoption process continues. If such a consultation has not previously taken place, the procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice   \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address at which the proposed regulation or resolution is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice.For non-priority projects, the municipality suspends the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted. If the municipality does not receive a sufficient number of referendum applications, the regulatory adoption process continues (e.g., establishment of compliance by the regional county municipality). Any use or activity aimed at controlling the spread of COVID-19 or similar measures (e.g., temporary hospitals, screening centres) are exempt from the process of amending urban planning by-laws. During a health emergency, the Minister of Health and Social Services has the power to order the construction of any work or the installation of facilities for health purposes or the provision of health and social services. To do so, the minister is not required to comply with the regulations in force.Borrowing regulations, credit commitments, and creation of financial reservesFor these projects, the municipality cannot undertake a registration process for qualified voters and referendum voting during a health emergency. As is normally the case, qualified voters cannot apply for these types of projects. However, in order to determine the applicable procedure, the municipality must first determine, by resolution requiring the support of two-thirds of the members of council, whether the project is a priority.For projects deemed a priority, the municipality will hold a written consultation. This consultation replaces the referendum process and no register is then opened. The procedure is as follows. The replacement of the registration process by a written consultation is first announced by a 15-day prior public notice. The ministère des Affaires municipales et de l’Habitation recommends that this public notice  \tdescribe the project that would have been the subject of a register, but is instead subject to a call for written comments.specify the web address where a detailed presentation of the project is posted.indicate that any person may submit written comments, by email or regular mail, for a period of 15 days following publication of the notice. \t\t For projects deemed to be non-priority, the municipality will suspend the regulatory adoption process. In this case, the register will be opened once the health emergency has been lifted. For all borrowing by-laws, regardless of the applicable procedure (priority project or project exempted from the referendum approval process), the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing must approve them, as is normally the case.Municipal territorial organization – The Act respecting  municipal territorial organization provides for the possibility of referendum approval processes in certain situations (municipal groupings, name change, change of regime, territorial annexation, attachment to a regional county municipality, etc.).  However, this process occurs only if the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing so orders, on the date stipulated by the latter. During a health emergency, if such a referendum process were to be ordered, it would not be held until the health emergency is lifted. The process would therefore be suspended until further notice.",

Where public notice of the registration process has been given, but the registration process has not begun, the notice is cancelled. The same applies if a registration process has been initiated but has not been completed. As such, the registration process is considered not to have taken place.

            "The disease is mainly contracted by close contact with an infected person. It is spread by respiratory droplets expelled from the nose or mouth of a person who is sick when they cough or sneeze. Droplets can be projected a maximum distance of 2 metres (around 6 feet) and fall quickly. This is why keeping a distance of 2 metres away from other people is recommended.Droplets can land on objects and surfaces near the person who just coughed or sneezed and survive for a short time. You must avoid touching these objects and surfaces with your hands and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.So far, there is no evidence that people contract the disease from the air, by airborne transmission far from an infected person."

            "Common cleaning and sanitizing methods used in the food industry should be continued and their frequency of use should be increased where possible. Other pathogenic microorganisms, generally more resistant than coronavirus, should not be overlooked.Currently, 70% alcohol and sodium hypochlorite are known to be particularly effective against coronavirus.Confirm with your suppliers how effective their cleaning and sanitizing procedures and products are against coronavirus. In case of doubt, it is best to keep the procedures already in place and always ensure that they are correctly applied, in accordance with manufacturer instructions.For non-food surfaces that are particularly exposed to the public (handles, crates, counters, etc.), more frequent cleaning using a disinfection method known to be effective against coronavirus is recommended. Health Canada has published a list of disinfectant products that can be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces.",
