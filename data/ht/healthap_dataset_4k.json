Precocious puberty (early puberty) is any evidence of puberty in a girl younger than 8 or a boy younger than 9. This is usually first explored with a history, physical, a study of your child's growth chart and possibly a bone age. A bone age is an x-ray - typically of the child's wrist - to show whether the child is maturing and growing faster, slower or on time with their actual age.   All this information can help tell whether the child is developing normally after all and should just be watched or whether they should have further work-up to determine if there is a hormone problem causing the early puberty. You should speak with your child's pediatrician or a pediatric endocrinologist who is the specialist that handles the work-up, diagnosis and treatment of these problems.  Good luck!"

We have seen a common night sweats picture in the men with prostate cancer with elevated estrogen levels. Swelling often starts around your neck.   We generally start with saliva testing which allows us to identify what the hormone imbalance actually is and treat accordingly. When we don't start with saliva testing we very often get very good success with progesterone cream in the form of wild yam cream. There are many different preparations of wild yam cream on the market and often the preparation does not have enough progesterone cream to be effective.

All this information can help tell whether the child is developing normally after all and should just be watched or whether they should have further work-up to determine if there is a hormone problem causing the early puberty.

In wet area, the blisters may break open, leaving ulcerated skin which is painful. Sometimes a number of blisters coalesce and this creates a larger lesion. In dry areas, the blisters can fill with crust before they scab over. The location of herpetic lesions expand over time. It is a  highly contagious disease."
